# Optimising-Starbucks-rewards-program
Starbucks is one of the largest coffehouses in the world. They have been known for having done one of the most vigorous digitalisaion strategies that has seen them grow to become titans in industry. In the first quarter of 2020, it witnessed a 16pc in year over year growth recording 18.9 million active users. It is infamous for its rewards program. According to starbucks, as of end of 2020, nearly a quarter of their transactions are done through the phone. This means that, a substantial amount of its revenue relies on the rewards app. In this project, we seek to analyse customer behavior of the starbucks rewards app so we can optimise profits by targetted marketing.
